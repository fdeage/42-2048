# 42-2048

## Overview

`2048` is a CLI-based game based on the [famous game](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048) from Gabriele Cirulli, that can be played on a board from 2x2 to 64x64. It can handle screen resizes during the game.

It needs the `libft` library to work. This repo doesn't include the `libft` source files, but includes an already-compiled `libft.a`. The `libft` sources can be found [here](https://github.com/fdeage/42-libft).

`2048` is a first-year project from the [42](#42) school, which I attended in 2013-2016. It abides to the strict rules of 42 not to exceed 5 functions per file, or 25 lines per function.


## Getting started

To compile and launch the project:
```
?> ./make
?> ./2048
```
